# Convolutional Neural Network Project

Nowadays the art of painting is a wide and well-known area in the world. Years pass and more painting styles appear, making difficult the task of identifying with certainty which is the style of a painting just by looking at it. Our purpose is to develop a model that helps with this problem. With this project, we want to build a Convolutional Neural Network model that can distinguish painting styles.
