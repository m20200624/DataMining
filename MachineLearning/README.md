## Predictive Model Project

This project was developed as a part of Machine Learning course, for the Masterâ€™s in Data Science and Advanced Analytics. 
Based on a 2048 dataset with 22400 observations, we were proposed to create a predictive model for a futuristic city called Newland.

Our purpose was to predict if the income of the population, that is on their way to Newland, is above or below the average, so that the government is able to know the tax rate to apply to each citizen.
After the predictions, the model will be applied to 10100 future citizens, that are represented in the test dataset.
