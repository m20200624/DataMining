# DataMining
## Customer Segmentation Project:

This project was developed as a part of the course of Data Mining from the master’s in Data Science and Advanced Analytics at Nova IMS.

We were proposed to analyse a sample of the results of one of PVA's recent fundraising appeals, containing 95412 donors.
PVA - Paralyzed Veterans of America - is non-profit organization that provides programs and services for US veterans with spinal cord injuries or disease.

Our job was to study a particular group of donors, lapsed donors. This group is represented by people who made their last donation 13 to 24 months ago, and so, it is our purpose to help recapture these former donors.

By the end of this project, we found the different segments of potential donors in order to be possible to express a marketing approach for each of those segments so that lapsed donors are more likely to give again. This means **clustering the data and understanding the donor’s behaviour, defining, describing and explaining each chosen cluster.**

In this project we discuss various approaches from more than one view and interpret the advantages and disadvantages of each decision to make the best possible final approach.
