# SQL Database, Querys and ETL

For this group project, we were asked to create a database for a fictitious online shop. We created a database for an online jewellery store, AITI Jewels. 
- **Shop description:**

To become a customer of the AITI Jewels, clients must fill a form composed of their name, birth year, phone number (optional) and email.  Additionally, it is saved the number of orders made and the money spent on it. 
Products are divided into categories and showed with a small description, their name, price, rating (given by the customers) and if a discount is available. 
A client can make an order by selecting the quantity of each product he wants and then needs to provide a delivery address. After choosing the products and before the payment, the client can apply any discount code available. An order is only considered finished when the payment of the order is made. Clients end up with a record where they can check when was the order made and the expected due date. 
The store provides the delivery service which is free unless the client makes an urgent request. 
To maintain the security of the website we dispose of an online security system (log) which stores every change made by the employees on the product prices. 

- **We were also proposed a challenge:**

The store acquired a small shop that was near to bankruptcy and to convert the old business clients ours we should make a promotion campaign.
We gave discounts on their first order and offered a bigger discount to the clients that spent the biggest amount of money in the old store (our potential best clients).
