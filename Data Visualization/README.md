# Infographic - Covid's Impact on our Digital World

- The kickoff idea for our research about the impacts
of the covid pandemic is:

**In 2020 the world stayed at home. We were all apart, but were we disconnected or more connected than ever?**

- We are also interested in investigating how the
internet access is different among countries, where
people went for information about covid, and what
they resorted to cope with the lockdown.

# We also developed a dashboard! 
Check the app at my colleague's GitHub repo: https://lnkd.in/d6H9_Sm

We made this app using Plotly and Dash where you can compare the footprint of different food products.
There you can explore the products whose productions emit more greenhouse gases and associate this with each supply chain step, their worldwide productions, and the water use.
